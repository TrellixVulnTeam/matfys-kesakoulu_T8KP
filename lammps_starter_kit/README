These are simple example runs for LAMMPS molecular dynamics code.
Used on course Computational nanoscience in the Department of Physics,
University of Helsinki.

Modified a bit for the Materials physics summer school 2016.

For instructions on how to obtain the code see file
'README.how_to_get'.

Example input files are in the following folders.

case1	: NVE simulation of a cubic box of copper
case2	: NPT heating simulation of a cubic box of copper
case3	: NVT simulation of a silicon cylinder
case4	: NVT and NPT simulation of an copper cylinder, coordinates read from file


In folder tools there is a gnuplot file to plot the data from a LAMMPS
example runs.


Linux commands to run the example in folder case1 and visualize using
ovito

	 cd case1
	 /your/path/to/lammps/lmp_serial -in ni.case1
	 /your/path/to/ovito/ovito case1.dump
	 

For some more info see file LAMMPS_tutorial-1x2.pdf. (It is originally
from a LAMMPS tutorial for another physics course.)
